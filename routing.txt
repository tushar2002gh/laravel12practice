Here are simple notes on routing in Laravel 12:

What is Routing?

Routing connects URLs (web addresses) to specific parts of your application's code (usually controllers or simple functions).
It tells Laravel what to do when a user visits a certain URL.
Key Concepts:

Routes are defined in routes/web.php (for web requests) and routes/api.php (for API requests).
Basic Syntax: Route::http_verb('uri', 'Action');
http_verb: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS. These indicate the type of request.
uri: The URL path (e.g., /, /users, /products/{id}).
Action: What happens when the URL is matched. Can be:
A Closure (an anonymous function directly in the route).
A Controller method (e.g., [UserController::class, 'index']).
Common HTTP Verbs:
GET: Used to retrieve data (displaying pages).
POST: Used to submit data (forms).
PUT/PATCH: Used to update existing data.
DELETE: Used to remove data.
Route Parameters: Use {} in the URI to capture dynamic parts of the URL.
Example: Route::get('/users/{id}', function ($id) { ... });
Named Routes: Give routes names using ->name('route.name'). Useful for generating URLs in your code.
Example: Route::get('/profile', [UserController::class, 'show'])->name('profile');
Generate URLs: route('profile').
Route Groups: Organize routes with shared attributes (like prefixes or middleware).
Example (with prefix):
PHP

Route::prefix('admin')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', function () { ... });
});
Simple Examples:

PHP

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
use App\Http\Controllers\HomeController;

// Route for the homepage
Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});

// Route to display a user with a specific ID
Route::get('/users/{id}', function ($id) {
    return 'User ID: ' . $id;
});

// Route to a controller method
Route::get('/home', [HomeController::class, 'index'])->name('home');

// Route for submitting a form
Route::post('/submit', function () {
    // Handle form submission
});
